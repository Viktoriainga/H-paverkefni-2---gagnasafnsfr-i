/*
ATH: 
Some of the problems have edge cases/corner cases that are not described here. 
It is important that your functions handle these by raising an exception. 
Generally,the later problems are more difficult than earlier ones, 
so if you are really quick to complete one of the later problems 
then it is a good idea to take a long hard look at it to make sure you really covered all possible cases.
